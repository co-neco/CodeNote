When using the function CreateRemoteThread,we have two choices choosing the base address of the remote thread.The one is use LoadLibrary 
(remote thread) and inject a DLL.When a DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH is notified,we can implement our thread in DllMain.The other is directly use a 
thread we write,but note in the thread,we can only use dynamic loading of functions,which includes getting the address of kernel32.dll.
Because if we use functions such as GetModuleHandle,the 'call' instruction will jump to a 'jmp' instruction,which may cause a access 
violation in target process's virtual space.
